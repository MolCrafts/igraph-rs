# igraph-sys

Raw FFI bindings to the [igraph](https://igraph.org/) C library, generated by [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen).

## Supported platforms

Linux and macOS only. Other targets will produce a compile-time error.

## How it works

The build script (`build.rs`) does two things:

1. Compiles igraph from the vendored source at `external/igraph` using cmake.
2. Generates Rust FFI bindings from `igraph.h` using the `bindgen` crate, outputting to `OUT_DIR`.

Pre-generated bindings are also committed at `src/bindings.rs` as a reference snapshot.

## Regenerating bindings

After updating the vendored igraph source, run:

```sh
cargo build -p igraph-sys --features regenerate
```

This rebuilds igraph and writes updated bindings to `src/bindings.rs` for committing.
