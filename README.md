# igraph-rs

Safe Rust bindings for [igraph](https://igraph.org/), a high-performance C library for graph analysis and network science.

## Features

- **Graph construction** -- create graphs from edge lists, or use built-in generators (ring, star, full, k-ary tree, Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, famous named graphs)
- **Graph queries** -- vertex/edge counts, neighbor lookup, degree sequences, adjacency checks
- **Algorithms** -- shortest paths, diameter, betweenness/closeness/eigenvector centrality, connected components, community detection (Louvain, label propagation), graph isomorphism (VF2, isoclasses)
- **Graph mutation** -- add/remove vertices and edges, contract vertices, reverse edges
- **Thread-safe** -- `Graph` implements `Send` (with `IGRAPH_ENABLE_TLS=ON`)
- **Vendored build** -- igraph C library is compiled from a bundled submodule via CMake, no system igraph installation needed

## Quick Start

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
igraph = { git = "https://github.com/MolCrafts/igraph-rs.git" }
```

```rust
use igraph::{Graph, NeighborMode};

fn main() -> igraph::Result<()> {
    // Build a small directed graph: 0->1, 1->2, 2->0, 2->3
    let g = Graph::from_edges(&[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 3)], 0, true)?;

    println!("vertices: {}, edges: {}", g.vcount(), g.ecount());
    println!("directed: {}", g.is_directed());

    // Shortest-path distances from every vertex to every other
    let dist = g.distances(NeighborMode::Out)?;
    println!("distance 0 -> 3: {}", dist[0][3]);

    // Betweenness centrality
    let bw = g.betweenness(false)?;
    println!("betweenness: {:?}", bw);

    Ok(())
}
```
